# **DOGE Changelog: USAID DEI Scholarships in Burma Cancellation**

### **February 2025 - Week 2**

## **Action Taken:**
**Cancellation of $45 Million USAID Diversity & Inclusion Scholarship Program (DISP) in Burma**

### **Summary:**
- The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has **canceled a $45,288,500 USAID contract** for the **Burma Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program (DISP).**
- The contract, originally awarded on **January 29, 2025**, was set to run until **August 15, 2028.**
- The **funds were designated to support higher education scholarships for Burmese youth, with a focus on vulnerable communities.**
- The contract was awarded to **Federal Egov IAE Initiative - Generic Entity Identifier**, an undisclosed for-profit federal contractor.
- USAID had planned to provide scholarships through **regional and local higher education institutions**, in collaboration with **U.S. universities and Burmese diaspora groups.**

## **DOGE Justification:**
- DOGE is targeting **foreign aid spending** deemed **non-essential** to U.S. interests.
- The **$45M cancellation** is part of a broader review of **USAID's $40B+ foreign aid expenditures.**
- Other scrutinized allocations include:
  - **$520M for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investments in Africa.**
  - **$1.2B in undisclosed federal contracts.**
- DOGE aims to **redirect funds toward domestic initiatives** and **reduce consultant-driven spending.**

## **Legal Challenge:**
- **Status:** The **cancellation has been blocked by a federal judge** pending further review.
- **Judge:** **Carl J. Nichols**
- The legal argument challenges whether DOGE has the **unilateral authority to revoke foreign aid contracts** after they have been awarded.
- USAID and advocacy groups argue that the program was **legally awarded and fulfills international commitments.**

## **Current Status:**
- **Contract Cancellation:** **Blocked** by judicial order.
- **Future of Funding:** **Uncertain** pending further litigation.
